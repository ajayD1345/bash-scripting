# To create alogin name of Altchool, and a home directory of /Home/Altschool
 sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -m Altschool

# d. Create an empty file called fileB in the misc directory then populate the file with a dummy content afterwards
 touch fileB
 nano fileB -- (using this coomand will make use of the nano text editor, it will take in to tthe file and you can edit the 
file however you please, but in this case we fill it with dummy content)
# e. Copy content from fileA into fileC
 (first your create fileC by using TOUCH command followed by your file name)
 cp fileA fileC -- ( after creating the fileC, you use this command to cp the file from fileA to fileC)
                                           
                                    OR
  cat fileA >> fileC -- ( Using this command will append the content of fileA to fileC. if fileC doesn't exit, it will be created)
# f. Move content of fileB to fileD
 touch fileD -- ( Create your fileD if it does'nt exit)
 mv fileB fileD
# g. Create a tar archieve called misc.tar for the contents of misc directory
 tar -cvf misc.tar fileA fileB fileC fileD
# h. Compress the tar archieve to create a misc.tar.gz file
 tar -czvf misc.tar.gz fileA fileB fileC fileD
# i. Create a user and force the user to change his/her password upon login
 sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash username
 sudo passwd username
 sudo chage -d 0 username
# j. lock a users password
